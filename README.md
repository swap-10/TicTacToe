# TicTacToe
A command line TicTacToe Game written completely in Python<br><br>
Includes boxes crudely drawn in the terminal using lines and underscores<br>
Does not work in Python IDLE, PyCharm IDE and possibly other IDEs as intended due to properties of msvcrt.kbhit()<br>
Works as intended in the terminal<br>
The code is for Windows only since windows specific keypress modules are used.<br><br>
Welcome to changes/improvements to make it work in Pycharm and other IDEs, and on Linux, or any other improvements or changes.<br>


Thanks and enjoy!
